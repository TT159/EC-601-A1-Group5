# RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification  
## Introduction
This  competition, initiated by **Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)** and **Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society (the MICCAI Society)**, is aimed to predict methylation of the **MGMT promoter**, which is a genetic biomarker important for the treatment of brian cancer.  

The dataset contains four types of **magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)** images with label 1 (MGMT promoter exists) or 0 (MGMT promoter doesn't exist).
